# Add functionality with packages

Packages are a way of re-using code while minimising copy-pasting and keeping upgrades and managing your dependencies easy.
Their functionality can widely vary from providing some debug helpers to a full scale "export to Excel" functionality.
As always when installing external things (like a new program on your computer, for example), ask yourself a couple of questions before doing so:
- Am I okay to be dependent on code from others for this project? What are the chances for this package to be abandoned?
- Is this package production ready yet? Does it have a reasonable amount of usage already?
- Is this package the best fit for my needs?

ðŸŒ± Install [clockwork](https://github.com/itsgoingd/clockwork). Experiment with all the extra debug features it provides.

ðŸŒ³ Explore Packagist / Github for other packages you like. Install and experiment at wish.

ðŸŒ³ Learn about the versioning system of your packages. Verify that you have set the versioning constraints in a safe way. (= it will not pull any breaking changes automatically) What's the role of `composer.lock` in all this?
