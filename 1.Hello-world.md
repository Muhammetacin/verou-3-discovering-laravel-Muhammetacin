# Hello world

Finally, your first steps into the Laravel world!
Let's get cooking - but what ingredients do we need?

- PHP
- Apache
- MySQL
- [Composer, an installer for PHP based packages](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-macos)

Luckily for us, most of these bits are already there.
But what about composer?
Composer is a tool that helps you manage any PHP installations, as npm can do for JS.
You can install it locally (available project wide) or globally (system wide, recommended).
If you have any trouble, you might want to read about how the [PATH variable](https://superuser.com/questions/284342/what-are-path-and-other-environment-variables-and-how-can-i-set-or-use-them) determines things to load on startup (so they can be accessed anywhere) or check with your coach.

Once we have the prerequisites, we can read about the [Laravel installation](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/installation#installation-via-composer).
There are multiple ways of installing and running Laravel, so keep in mind which one you are using.

```bash
# Get your copy of Laravel
composer create-project laravel/laravel example-app
# Enter the folder
cd example-app
# Run the server (this is a built-in server you may use as an alternative of your Apache - both options are fine)
php artisan serve
```

Do you now have a project called `example-app`?
Guess we know who's buying the drinks next time! 🍻
Change it to your intended project name.
Remember to double check code snippets you found online, and adapt them for your use case.

> What about installing with Laravel Sail? This is an option based on a Docker container: it contains your full environment (PHP, Apache, ...) and is specific to your project. Since we already have most of what we need, we'll actually use our available local setup.

## Must-have features
🌱 Use the [Laravel routing system](https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-8-from-scratch/episodes/5) to show a simple `hello world` on the screen.
Apply (part of) the MVC structure: the route will go to a controller, which will then load the view.

> I don't see a thing! Laravel has a public folder, which is supposed to become the root for serving your website once it lives online. For now, just add /public to your url to run it from that folder.

## Nice-to-have features
🌼 Find out about named routes. Add two more pages who link to each other using that name.

🌳 Figure out how you can access any `$_GET` parameters in your controller *without* using any superglobals.

> During our dive into Laravel, there'll be must haves (🌱), doable extra's (🌼) and slightly more difficult ones (🌳). That should everyone to get the basics and allow you to go deeper if wou can.

He said "Hello world!" on the first date. Not awkward, not awkward at all...
