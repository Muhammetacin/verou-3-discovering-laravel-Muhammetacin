# Using eloquent to build queries

Queries? Did someone mention queries?
I'm ready for some data! First things first, of course:

ðŸŒ± Do some research on how [config works in Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/configuration#environment-configuration). For now, we've worked with a single small file. In a framework, it can be a lot bigger! But as always: only focus on what you need.

ðŸŒ± Make a database and add your [database credentials](https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-8-from-scratch/episodes/17) to you project. Figure out a way to do so without having them in Git. (tip: .env files are perfect for this)

> Think twice before comitting your database credentials - do you want to add these to a public repo?. How did we deal with sensitive config fiels earlier?

Now we are ready to use eloquent. What does it bring to the table?
- An easy to write syntax for your queries.
- If you switch from database system, eloquent will automatically adapt all your queries.
- Eloquent will provide your data as models (= classes that contain specific data, e.g. a User class) instead of "dumb" arrays.
- Performing joins can become complex, especially when multiple levels deep (= nesting). Eloquent makes this easier by defining relationships between your models.

> Want to debug quickly in Laravel? Use the `dd($aVariableToShow)` for a quick "die and dump": you'll nicely see your variable displayed, and stop the execution of things Ã fter your dd.

ðŸŒ± Research [models and eloquent (the basics)](https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-8-from-scratch/episodes/19) in Laravel.

ðŸŒ± Make a table for your form entries, and create a model class.

ðŸŒ± Use eloquent to save the data after a form submit.

> These models are classes that contain the data (and maybe later functions), but are also used to perform the queries. This pattern is called active record.

ðŸŒ¼ What other info on the site can come from the database? Provide tables & models, and make the content dynamic.

ðŸŒ³ Experiment with eloquent relationships for data that is linked together (= relational data).

ðŸŒ³ Look into [query scopes](https://dev.to/bertheyman/the-magic-of-query-scopes-in-laravel-pfp). Can you use them to split your queries into reusable blocks?

Speaking eloquently takes time, as does writing queries...
