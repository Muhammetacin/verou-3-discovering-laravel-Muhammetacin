# Compiling assets with Laravel mix

We now have a lot of functionality at our disposal to start building... but what about the styling?
Modern application use Webpack to process all files and combine them into one (for better performance) and rewrite them to something that a browser can understand (sass/scss to css for example).
It comes with a bit more setup than a simple UI tool, but offers a lot of functionality and isn't limited to compiling only sass/scss files.
[Laravel mix](https://laracasts.com/series/learn-laravel-mix/episodes/1) is an extra layer on top of Webpack that allows for easier configuration.
It can bring your config file from a couple of 100 lines to 10.

> Laravel has two locations for your styling: resources for the raw source, and the compiled result will end up in the public folder.

ðŸŒ± Run `npm install` to get all JS dependencies (this includes the webpack compiler).

ðŸŒ± Adapt the setup to allow you to write scss and compile this to css using Laravel mix.

ðŸŒ¼ Get rid of bootstrap and switch to your own styling.

ðŸŒ³ Tailwind css is a utility-first approach. This means it's not about full components (as is Bootstrap), but rather about classes that do one specific thing. With some extra steps, mix can compile this as well. Adapt your setup and give Tailwind a try.

> Is Tailwind the next big thing? As always with web trends, they come and go. Give it a try and see what works for you - be aware of the current trend, but don't use something only because it's the new kid in the block.

When you combine it all together:
