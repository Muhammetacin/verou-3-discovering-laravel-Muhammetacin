# Building a view with blade

In views, Laravel is using Blade (however you can easily switch to regular PHP or plain HTML).
Blade offers you similar behaviour to PHP, but adapted to views:

- More readable when mixed with HTML.
- No need to reach for open / close tags for PHP all the time.
- Limited logic available to help you do your logic in your controllers.

## Blade

ðŸŒ± Find [some documentation](https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-8-from-scratch/episodes/14) on Blade. Make yourself familiar with [the syntax](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/blade#blade-directives).

ðŸŒ± Build the homepage using Blade. Have at least three parts: your actual page, and a header and footer to be included.
Provide some content for this page to your liking.
Use Bootstrap (or another components based css framework) for the styling. (don't spend too much on styling)

 Switch to one general layout containing your html skeleton. The loaded view should extend from this layout and add page specific content.

## Forms

ðŸŒ± Build a simple form in your view.

ðŸŒ± In Laravel, a route will only respond to a specific type of request (GET or POST for example). Add a route that will react to the form submit (POST method). You'll also need an extra function in your controller.

ðŸŒ± Find out how you can access form information (after submitting, that is) from the request [(hint hint)](https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-8-from-scratch/episodes/45) in your controller in Laravel. Tip: there's a recommended way, not using the normal superglobals like `$_GET` and `$_POST`. We'll save this info in the next step.

ðŸŒ¼ Provide simple validation for your form (do so in your controller).

ðŸŒ¼ Customize the validation error messages (can be EN, no need to switch to NL).

ðŸŒ³ Use a request class to provide the validation. Although a more complex approach, this makes your validation reusable in other places - always think what approach will serve you best.
