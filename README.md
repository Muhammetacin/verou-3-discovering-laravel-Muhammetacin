# Discovering Laravel

- Repository: `discovering-laravel`
- Mode: `solo`
- Type of Challenge: `learning`
- Duration: `week-ish`

## Your mission

We'll build a small website together to discover all we need for that in our first proper framework.
Take a moment to come up with a good topic for it and [get started](1.Hello-world.md)!

## Tips & tricks

This exercise is divided in parts that are all designed to last for about a day (give or take).
All instructions are divided in must-do's and extra's to give you a chance to do all topics, and go in-dept when you have the time.

A framework like Laravel is really, really big. Try to focus your learning on what you need at that moment. 
Don't hesitate to reach out if you feel like going in circles or do some pair programming with another learner.

The ["Laravel from scratch"](https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-8-from-scratch) series at Laracasts can be a really valuable resource.
Laravel has been updated since, so make sure to check for syntax updates if you run into any problems. Usually they warn you about it, so make sure to read any info below the video. 
The challenges will often refer to a certain chapter of this series - feel free to work with other resources if they work better for you!

> Even with potential new versions of Laravel being released, most of older video courses on Laracasts are still relevant. If you want to make sure, combine those with the release notes to get yourself fully up-to-date!

Everyone learns at his/her own pace, which means that your coach might have to switch between topics a lot every day.
Think about the "how to ask questions" session when requesting help: explain what you want to do, what you tried and where you ended up.

## Good luck, and enjoy the journey!
